# The "original" TLDs

## `.com`

**Use Case:** "commercial"–can be used by anyone, sort of through the weirdness of early internet history became the default top-level domain for commercial or personal use.

**Managed By:** Initially managed by Network Solutions, Inc. as a contractor to the U.S. government, it's now managed by Verisign, Inc.

## `.net`

**Use Case:** "network"–originally intended for distributed networks of computers.

**Managed By:** Verisign, Inc.

## `.org`

**Use Case:** "organization"–originally intended for non-profit organizations only (and used by many non-profits for this reason), it's also appropriated by less benevolent initiatives (see internet.org)

**Managed By:** the Public Interest Registry, a domain registrar created by the non-profit organization Internet Society.

## `.edu`

**Use Case:** "educational"–what's considered an "educational" means more "institutions of education". As of 2001 the domain is actually only for United States education institutions accredited by any agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.

**Managed By:** Educause, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting higher education IT initiatives, is responsible for the TLD, although they actually contract out this work to…surprise! Verisign again.

## `.gov`

**Use Case:** U.S. state and federal agencies

**Managed By:** The General Services Administration contracts out maintenance of this TLD to Verisign.

## `.mil`

**Use Case:** United States military

**Managed By:** The U.S. Department of Defense
