## 1: Topic introduction

- Review of homework on Net Neutrality:
  - Did you know about Net Neutrality?
  - Did you think it was a good thing?
  - Did you think about the negative aspects of it being put into law?
  - Are there reasons for traffic shaping or blocking connections
  - Why are large tel-cos interested in treating different internet traffic differently
  - How may this affect peer-to-peer applications?
  - How may a community mesh network affect this?
- Network is a limited resource that is determined by the infrastructure
- Discuss the need for keeping a pulse of the network
  - What attributes are important to monitor
  - How are these attributes measured?
  - Identify units and what they mean
  - Where have we seen it in our daily lives?

## 2: Hands-on and material exploration

Monitor flow of network traffic using different tools as we do every day digital things.

### Objectives

Learn how these metrics affect us in our day to day lives, and in contrast how the same metrics affect others.

### Materials

- Your cellphone
- Some sort of public WiFi or internet connection
- A Raspberry Pi 3 for each participant labeled with the SSID for the node
- SD cards with pre-flashed images with all required software
- Laptops that can establish a SSH session to each Raspberry Pi (each running a Host AP with unique SSID)
- USB WiFi radio that is [ad-hoc or 802.11s-capable](https://github.com/phillymesh/802.11s-adapters) for each Raspberry Pi 3

### Format

Groups (or pairs) to start, class discussion then back to groups again

### Activity

As the whole class:

a. Review your cell phone usage:
  - Identify your apps' data usage
  - Record a few of the top apps that took up the most data
  - Was this data cellular, or WiFi?

b. Public WiFi speed test:
  - Use a speed test tool (e.g. speedtest.net) to test the speed of the public WiFi, record the result
  - Is it faster or slower than the connection you have at home? 
  - Run the speed test again, record the result
  
c. Discuss measurements and units:
  - What unit is the data usage of your apps measured in?
  - What does MB mean?
  - What was some of the top app and how much MB did it use? 
    - Have participants volunteer their info if they feel comfortable doing so
  - Was that surprising?
  - Would you be more/less surprised if it was cellular data? What if it was WiFi data? 
    - Are different data sources worth more?
    - Why? What is your cell data limit?
  - What unit was the WiFi speed measured in?
  - What does Mbps mean?
  - How does this relate to the MB from apps?
  - Why was the speed different between tests?
  
d. Show Grafana functioning on a mesh node and describe what it is:
  - Access via web interface
  - Show how to select nodes
  
Break into smaller groups:

- Connect to the node
- Access the Grafana interface and look around
- Stream a music file that is located on a node's local webserver and observe the metrics
- Stream a video file that is located on a node's local webserver and observe the metrics
- Observe what metrics change if you do the same from a remote node (over the mesh)
- Can you measure both nodes at the same time?

Discuss results in larger group and ask the following questions:

- Did difficulty increase measuring two nodes at the same time?
- What would happen if we have a city-wide mesh?
  - Ping time
  - Throughput
  - CPU usage
- Are some metrics more important than others?
- How do you represent a mesh network?
  - Physical network topology (e.g. [Toronto Mesh map](https://tomesh.net/map/))
  - Virtual peering topology (e.g. [fc00.org](https://www.fc00.org/))

## 3: Discussion and reflection activity

Q & A about sharing broken Internet experiences, understanding failure points and why we measure

  - Break into 3 groups
  - Each group is assigned a user profile
    - Gamer
    - Streamer (Youtube, Netflix, etc.)
    - Web user with occasional video conferencing calls (web, email, instant messaging, Skype, Hangout, etc.)
  - Spend 10 minutes discussing the characteristics of this user and what metrics are important to them and why. Consider some of these questions:
    - What are the most used services by the user?
    - How would the user be affected if internet access becomes unavailable?
    - What would the user consider as "internet went down"?
    - What is the threshold for the user?
      - Packet loss / poor link quality
      - Latency / ping
      - Bandwidth speed
      - Bandwidth allotment
    - Does network traffic trend change throughout the day for the user's connection?
    - Look at your local internet provider (Bell, Rogers, etc.), which plan would you suggest for them and why?
    - Does wired vs wireless affect the experience?
  - Have each group spend 2 minutes presenting their user profile and their findings
  - Make the assumption that the 3 profiles live in the same household, does that change any of the recommendations is so how?
  - How will things change if services are accessed through / hosted on a community mesh network?

## 4: Wrap-up and week ahead

- Read Sonia Bussu's perspective on [public engagement in the development of IoT](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2014/12/13/public-engagement-on-the-internet-of-things-is-essential-if-we-are-to-put-societal-values-at-the-centre-of-technological-developments/)
- Browse [Public Lab's website of DIY science projects](https://publiclab.org/methods). Are there any projects of your own that you might want to use technology to explore?
- Optional: Watch the National Film Board series on Antennas:
