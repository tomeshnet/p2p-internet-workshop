## 1: Topic - Network Deployment Planning

### Objectives

- List features of a wifi or mesh deployment
- Explain and summarize important factors to consider for deployment

### Materials

- Class Presentation
- Class Shared Notes (i.e., using Riseup Pad or something similar)

### Activity

- Presentation on Deployment (8 min)
- Planning Considerations Activity (8 min)
  1. Split into groups/pairs
  1. Assign each group a case from [WNDW](http://wndw.net/caseStudies.html) (5 exist)
  1. Ask the groups to read through the cases, identify aspects to keep in mind when planning and present a summary to the group of what they anticipate
  1. Collect responses on in class shared notes and discuss

## 2: Hands-on - Mapping the Fort York Micro Mesh

### Objectives

- Sketch out and prototype an imagined Fort York Micro Mesh

### Materials

- Printed map (previous class confirm location. Ask if people live nearby, < 10min walk) and would be up for using their home)
- Google Earth
- Hardware examples

### Activity

- Introduce Group Mapping Exercise 
  - Based on [Commotion Construction Kit](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/): "[Every Network Tells a Story](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/design-your-network-every-network-tells-story/)"
  - Describe Routers and Rules
- Group Mapping 
- Discussion, Show & Tell

## 3: Discussion and reflection activity

- Ask group to review planning considerations in light of the mapping activity
  - Have someone as note-taker update the original list
- Review the 3 other planning activities in the [Commotion Construction Kit](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/):
  - [Survey your Neighbors](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/survey-your-neighbors/)
  - [Identify Neighbourhood Skills](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/identify-neighborhood-skills/)
  - [Inventory your Neighbourhood](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/inventory-the-neighborhood/)
- With remaining time, jointly brainstorm an Outreach Strategy for Toronto Mesh, starting in their neighbourhood
  - Have someone as note-taker add to class shared notes  

## 4: Wrap-up and week ahead

- Next session we will talk about Net Neutrality and _why_ and _how_ to "keep the pulse of a network"

### Homework 

- Watch [Net Neutrality - 6 Minute Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zASHI9qdB0U) by drawntoknowledge _(NOTE: This video incorrectly labeled ISPs as Tier 1 providers, however this does not impact the video's message)_
- Watch selection of ["The Internet We Want" Panel starting @ 27:00](https://youtu.be/PtO4rPPBWjY?t=27m00s)
- Optional: Read "[A plan to rescue the Web from the Internet](https://staltz.com/a-plan-to-rescue-the-web-from-the-internet.html)" by Andrew Staltz
