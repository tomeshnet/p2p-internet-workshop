Hello,

We are excited for the first Building the Peer-to-Peer Internet workshop, and we hope you are too! The workshops run on Tuesdays, April 10 to May 15 from 6:30-8:00 p.m. at the Fort York library. Here are a few notes to get you ready for the first session.

1. Please complete the pre-workshop survey [ link to survey ]. We use this to set the pace of the workshop and, together with a post-workshop survey, to assess how it went in order to improve for future sessions.
2. Make sure you have administrator privileges on your laptop. 
3. We will be using an SSH client and Text Editor software. You likely already have it installed on your computer. Set up instructions can be found at https://github.com/tomeshnet/p2p-internet-workshop/blob/master/SETUP.md

If you have any trouble, send us an email at hello@tomesh.net or come a little early Tuesday April 10 before the class.

If you are no longer able to attend, please let us know at hello@tomesh.net so that we can offer your seat to someone on the waitlist.

We are committed to making sure that the workshop is accessible to everyone. Please tell us if there is anything we should know in advance in order to make the workshop accessible for you (e.g. sign-language interpreters, large-print handouts, lactation facilities).

Looking forward to seeing you soon!

Best,
