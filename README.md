# Building the Peer-to-Peer Internet

**Workshop Series** _by Toronto Mesh_, [tomesh.net/peer-to-peer-internet](https://tomesh.net/peer-to-peer-internet/)

## Description

Participants will learn about community networks, wireless mesh networks, distributed applications, and train their pet Raspberry Pi to do networking things. While this course assumes no technical expertise, all sessions contain a technical hands-on component and a reflection activity to explore the role of technologies on our society. A socially-minded tinkerer who enjoys a collaborative learning experience will be the ideal participant.

Participants will be expected to bring their own laptop. 

**Schedule:** Tuesdays April 10 - May 15, [register through the Toronto Public Library workshop](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDMEVT23011&R=EVT23011)  
**Duration:** 1.5 hours per week for 6 weeks  
**Discussion:** https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#reading-networks:tomesh.net

## Module Topics

1. [What is mesh?](./module-1.md)
1. [Setting up your first node](./module-2.md)
1. [Building nodes (hardware)](./module-3.md)
1. [Planning a network](./module-4.md)
1. [Measuring networks](./module-5.md)
1. [Living on a decentralized network](./module-6.md)

## Learning Outcomes

- Working with Raspberry Pi's to make a network router
- Building mesh networks and running peer-to-peer applications
- Understanding the barriers to access and the history of the internet in Toronto as well as mesh networks worldwide
- Unpacking the values of distributed vs. centralized systems
- Applying network security and private communications
- Starting and maintaining a sustainable community mesh network

## Expectations

- Participants will bring your own laptop
- TPL will provide Raspberry Pi 2's and we will try to provide Raspberry Pi 3's
- Participants are comfortable using a computer before, with no assumptions about prior programming or networking knowledge
- We will provide a primer before first class about Linux shell

## Course Design

### Objectives

- Create syllabus with sufficient flexibility so it can be adapted to Toronto Libraries in other areas and other settings
- With a community network project as basis, establish regular hack nights at the Toronto Libraries' Innovation Hubs
- Engage students and equip them with necessary knowledge to continue involvement in local mesh community efforts
- Publish this as open-source syllabus that other communities can adopt to kick-start a mesh community
