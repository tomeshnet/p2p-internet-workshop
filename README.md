# Building the Peer-to-Peer Internet Syllabus

**Workshop Series** _by Toronto Mesh_

## Description

**Description:** Participants will learn about community networks, wireless mesh networks, distributed applications, and train their pet Raspberry Pi to do networking things. While this course assumes no technical expertise, all sessions contain a technical hands-on component and a reflection activity to explore the role of technologies on our society. A socially-minded tinkerer who enjoys a collaborative learning experience will be the ideal participant.

**Duration:** 1.5 hour weekly sessions for 6 weeks

**Discussion:** https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#reading-networks:tomesh.net

## Learning Outcomes

- Working with Raspberry Pi's to make a network router
- Building mesh networks and running peer-to-peer applications
- Understanding the barriers to access and the history of the Internet in Toronto and mesh networks around the world
- Unpacking the values of distributed vs. centralized systems
- Applying network security and private communications
- Starting and maintaining a sustainable community mesh network

## Module Topics

1. What is mesh?
1. Setting up your first node
1. Building nodes (hardware)
1. Planning a network
1. Measuring networks
1. Living on a decentralized network

## Our Objectives (Internal)

- Create syllabus with sufficient flexibility so it can be adapted to Toronto Libraries in other areas and other settings
- With a community network project as basis, establish regular hack nights at the Toronto Libraries' Innovation Hubs
- Engage students and equip them with necessary knowledge to continue involvement in local mesh community efforts
- Publish this as open-source syllabus that other communities can adopt to kick-start a mesh community

## Prerequisites (Internal)

- Bring your own laptop
- Provide Raspberry Pi 3's
- Expect audience to have used a computer before, with no assumption of prior programming or networking knowledge
- Linux primer before first class (access to some shell at home for practice)
