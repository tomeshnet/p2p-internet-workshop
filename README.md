# Workshop Series Syllabus by Toronto Mesh

**Building The Peer-to-Peer Internet** by Toronto Mesh

## Course Description

**Description:** Participants will learn about community networks, wireless mesh networks, distributed applications, and train their pet Raspberry Pi to do networking things. While this course assumes no technical expertise, all sessions contain a technical hands-on component and a reflection activity to explore the role of technologies on our society. A socially-minded tinkerer who enjoys a collaborative learning experience will be the ideal participant.

**Duration:** 4-6 weeks duration, 1.5 hour sessions (TBD)

**Discussion:** https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#reading-networks:tomesh.net

## Our Objectives

- Create syllabus with sufficient flexibility so it can be adapted to Toronto Libraries in other areas and other settings
- With a community network project as basis, establish regular hack nights at the Toronto Libraries' Innovation Hubs
- Engage students and equip them with necessary knowledge to continue involvement in local mesh community efforts
- Publish this as open-source syllabus that other communities can adopt to kick-start a mesh community

## Prerequisites (Internal)

- Bring your own laptop
